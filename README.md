I prepared this for my first ever hackathon. 
first i tried making different files for different functions like data fetcher and data analysis but i was facing many errors while bringing everything together so i ended up putting all my python code in one file.
i know its not clean but let me guide you:- 
First we have a data fetcher which fetches data from the api that i provided it and presents the data in a tabular format. I didnt know much about stock graphs so i asked chatgpt to tell me how to label the rows and coloumns.
Second i made a data analysis function which would do the analysis of the data and provide us the SMA(Simple moving average) of the last 10 stocks and also of the last 30 stocks. 
Third i created a notifier which notify's the graph right after 60 seconds.
Fourth i added a main file which provides us the forntend of our visualizer.
Fift i created a c++ file which would help in faster data processing (i used vectors to make it simpler for which one of my seniors helped me).
Thats it.
